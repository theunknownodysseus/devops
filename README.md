# DevOps Learning Journey

I am writing this documentation to record my journey for learning the fundamentals of DevOps and the tools that make it possible.

## Day 1
Worked on Git and GitHub, and created a VM running in VMware. Learned how to use Linux and connected it. Faced several conflicts including additional drivers making the VM unstable, inefficient partitions, and live server problems.

## Day 2
Resolved the issues from yesterday and connected the VM's SSH to VS Code. Started working on it. Learned Docker fundamentals including how it works, why it works, and its components. Also learned basic commands: `ps`, `run`, `stop`, `rm`, `build`, and adding tags.

## Day 3
Installed Jenkins and learned more about Docker. Created a simple SPA using HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js for the server. Learned about using Nginx.

## Day 4
Created custom Jenkins jobs and triggered jobs using other jobs. Ran a container using source code from Git via Jenkins. Used pipelines for the same workflow. Faced disk space issues, cleared local cache, expanded disk space by adding 50GB, merged disks, and resolved repeated Git clone and running container problems.
