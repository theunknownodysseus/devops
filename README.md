I am writing this documentation to record my journey for learning the fundamentals of DevOps and the tools that make it possible.
On Day 1:
    I worked on Git and GitHub, and created a VM , which is running in VMWare ,learnt how to use linux and i connected it to it , i faced a lot of conflicts, since the additional drivers made the vm go crazy , inefficient partitions and live server problem 
On Day 2:
    First i resolved the issues i faced yesterday and connected my vm's ssh to the vsc and started working on it. Learnt dockers and how it works and why it workds and about it's components and also i learnt a few commands like , ps , run , stop , rm , build , and adding tags 
On Day 3: 
    Installed Jenkins ,learnt about dockers a bit more , created a simple SPA using html , css, js , nodejs - for a server , learnt using nginx 
On Day 4:
    Create own jobs , triggered jobs using other jobs , ran a container using whose src is in git using jenkins and used pipelines to do the same , and i faced a issue of not enough disk space , cleared the local cache and the expanded the disk space by adding an extra 50GB and merged the disks and made the space enough and managed the issues the repeated git clones and the running container issues
