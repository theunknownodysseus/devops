Terraform 
    Infrastructure as a Code(IaC)

    we mannually create server and configured the networks and do stuffs in console of aws , this is not version controlled and it is prone to human errors and this has to be done multiple times 

    so IaC means you write the infrastructure using code instead of clicking 

    like for creating a ec2 instance :

    resource "aws_instance" "name"{
        ami = ami-123456
        instance_type = "t2_micro"
    }

    

    terraform apply

    this is used to create , modify , destroy infrastructure 

    It can handle multiple cloud , it is declarative ,  version control friendly , resuable modules , has an ecosystems and execution plan before applying 


    ARCHI :

        terraform core - reads , execute and talks to providers(aws , azure , docker  - all these are api plugins)

        State file - stores state

        init , apply , plan , destroy


        instead of tyoing the variable's value directly we use a .tf file :
                    
            variable "instance_type" {
            type    = string
            default = "t2.micro"
            }

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
