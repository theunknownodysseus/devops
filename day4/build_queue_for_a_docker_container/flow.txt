(Can also be done with SCM (Source Code Management) & github)

myresumerunner-builder:
    A Jenkins job (myresumerunner-builder) that pulls code from a GitHub repository and runs a series of build steps.
    It’s configured to connect to a Git repository, trigger builds in response to events (like code changes or schedules), and run commands (e.g., git clone, navigate into the project, and other shell steps).


    Execute Shell :
    git clone https://github.com/theunknownodysseus/buildqueuetesting.git
    cd buildqueuetesting

myresumerunner-image:
    A Jenkins job that builds a Docker image from the code located in the myresumerunner-builder/workspace path (specifically the buildqueuetesting directory).
    It starts the build when the myresumerunner-builder sucessfully executed 

    Execute Shell :
    cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/myresumerunner-builder/buildqueuetesting
    docker build -t gogogaga .
    echo "image build - varun " 

myresumerunner-run:
    A Jenkins job that runs a Docker container from the image gogogaga using the command:
    
    docker run -d -p 8050:5000 gogogaga

    Execute Shell :
    cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/myresumerunner-image
    docker run -d -p 8050:5000 gogogaga
    echo "running the container - varun"


    This is how I made it.
