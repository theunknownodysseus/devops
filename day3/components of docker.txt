Components of Docker

        Docker Engine
            Runs the containers , it has :
                                            Docker daemon (bg service)
                                            Docker CLI 

        Docker Image 
            It is a blueprint or a template , it contains :
                                            OS Layer 
                                            Application 
                                            Dependencies
                                            Configuration
            They are read only

        Docker Container
                        Running instance of an image (object - container , class - image)
                        docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx 
                        Same ports for multiple apps creates conflicts

        Dockerfile 
                    Instructions on how to build a image 
                    FROM pulls an image
                    use alphine for image with lower size
                    WORKDIR-working directory
                    COPY og file  destination file 
                    CMD , commands in an list of strings 

        Docker Registry
                    central and distributed system for images 

        Docker Hub 
                    Has Docker Images - Image store


        Docker Workflow
                        write code -> 
                            create dockerfile -> 
                                build image ->
                                    push image to docker hub ->
                                        pull image on server ->
                                                        run the container
